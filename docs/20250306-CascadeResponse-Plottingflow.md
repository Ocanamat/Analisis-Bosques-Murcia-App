> ok. So here is the status of the development: 1. the user loads an excel file, selects which sheets are to be joined, and clicks ok and the ui moves to the graph constructor tab 2. in the graph constructor the user drags and drops variables onto grammar of graphics features, so that the can be visualized in real time on a pyqtgraph drawn onto the plot_widget qtwidget. what is your proposed solution steps to add a dynamic graph(could be bars, could be a histogram, depends on what the user chooses on the constructor tab), map the grammar graphics model with the dragged variables onto the unified_df and plot the corresponding graph on the plot_widget widget?

Based on the current state of development, I'll propose a step-by-step solution to implement the dynamic graphing functionality that connects the unified dataframe with the grammar of graphics model and renders plots using [[PyQtGraph]]. Here's my proposed approach:

## Solution Steps for Dynamic Graphing

### 1. Set Up PyQtGraph in the Refactored Main Window

First, we need to initialize PyQtGraph in the refactored main window:

- Add PyQtGraph imports
- Initialize the plot widget
- Configure plot settings (background, grid, legend)
- Add the plot widget to the plot_widget container

### 2. Create a Plot Controller

Create a dedicated controller to manage the plotting logic:

- Handle the connection between grammar model and data model
- Process user selections from the grammar constructor
- Generate appropriate plots based on selected variables and grammar elements
- Update plots when selections change

### 3. Implement Grammar-to-Plot Mapping

Create a mapping system that translates [[grammar of graphics]] concepts to PyQtGraph elements:

- Map aesthetics (color, size, shape) to PyQtGraph styling options
- Map geoms (bar, line, scatter) to appropriate PyQtGraph plot types
- Map facets to subplot arrangements
- Handle scales and coordinate systems

### 4. Implement Variable Drag-and-Drop Functionality

Enhance the existing drag-and-drop system to:

- Allow variables from the unified dataframe to be dragged to grammar elements
- Update the grammar model when variables are assigned
- Trigger plot updates when assignments change

### 5. Create Plot Generation Logic

Implement the core plotting logic:

- Extract relevant data from the unified dataframe based on selected variables
- Apply appropriate transformations based on grammar specifications
- Generate the correct plot type (bar, line, scatter, etc.)
- Handle aggregations and grouping as needed

### 6. Add Real-time Plot Updates

Ensure plots update in real-time:

- Connect signals from the grammar model to the plot controller
- Implement efficient update mechanisms to avoid full redraws when possible
- Add animation for transitions between plot states

### 7. Implement Plot Interaction Features

Add interactive features to the plots:

- Zooming and panning
- Data point inspection (tooltips)
- Legend toggling
- Export options
